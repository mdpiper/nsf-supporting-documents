*NSF-EAR 1226297 GEO/BIO/ACI*: $4.5M (10/01/12--9/31/18)  
*Title*: Computational Infrastructure for the Community Surface Dynamics
Modeling System  
*PI*: J.P.M. Syvitski; Senior Personnel: M. Piper (and others).

*Intellectual Merit*:
This is an NSF-supported, international and community-driven program
that seeks to transform the science and practice of earth-surface
dynamics modeling. One of the main focuses of the project is to aid in
model development and model coupling. Integration Facility staff have
published 48 peer-reviewed papers and provided 85 presentations.

*Broader Impacts*:
The CSDMS 2 has organized, hosted or sponsored 118 workshops, symposia and
meetings, and offered 22 short courses and 36 clinics. The CSDMS Model
Repository hosts 196 open-source models, and 60 modeling tools. CSDMS's
diverse community of 1370 members represents 176 U.S. institutions
(129 academic, 26 private, 21 federal) and 315 non-U.S. institutions
(210 academic, 31 private, 74 government) from 68 countries.

*Publications* (Full citations in the reference section):
The CSDMS 2 project has resulted in 48 peer-reviewed publications and
85 abstracts.
