Budget Justification
====================

Mark Piper
----------

*1.0 months in year 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5*

Requirements include knowledge of software engineering methodologies,
exerience in building model coupling cyberinfrastructure,
demonstrated skill in developing with high level (e.g. Python, MATLAB)
and operational level (e.g. C, Fortran, Java) programming languages,
and research-level experience in numerical modeling techniques
(e.g. Eulerian, Lagrangian, implicit/explicit solvers,
finite difference, and finite element methods).

Mark Piper is a Research Software Engineer on the NSF-funded
Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) project.
He has proven experience in multi-language codes,
and in building and maintaining the CSDMS model coupling cyberinfrastructure.
Duties will include
overseeing and coordinating the model development
necessary to componentize the identified models
so that they conform to the CSDMS model-coupling protocols
and to bring them into the CSDMS Modeling Framework.

*Because Piper has multiple proposals currently funded with NSF,
if his appointment should exceed fully funded
he will redistribute some of these tasks to other assigned personnel.
Piper is non-tenure track faculty and is funded on soft money.
Due to nature of the work assigned to the PI,
we are requesting salary commensurate with the level of effort required,
and in excess of NSF's normal allowance
of two months per investigator designated as senior personnel
across all funded NSF projects.*

Accounting Technician and System Administration
-----------------------------------------------

*System Administration: 0.0348 months/yr in years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5*  
*Accounting Specialist: 0.115 months/yr in years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5*

Partial salary is requested for technical assistance
to support the executing, administration and accounting
of Center activities.
INSTAAR is a unique unit of the University of Colorado.
It is solely dedicated to research and completely separated,
though complimentary, to the traditional academic departments.
INSTAAR is an interdisciplinary Earth and Environmental Systems Institute,
and houses large and complex research programs.
Each individual investigator has access to a depth and broad range
of scientific expertise that complements his/her research.
The system Administrator is responsible for the IT needs of the project.

Fringe Benefits
---------------

Fringe Benefits are calculated on requested salary per the
University's federally negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement
with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).
Applicable rates are 36.6 percent for academic faculty,
37.6 percent for research personnel,
and 13.2 percent for graduate research assistants.

Travel
------

Travel is requested to attend two meetings
of the Americal Geophysical Union (AGU).
In year 2, the 2021 AGU Fall Meeting in New Orleans, LA
(Airfare Denver to New Orleans at $350;
5 nights at $200 per night;
5 days per diem at $76 per day;
ground transportation at $100).
In year 4, the 2023 AGU Fall Meeting in San Francisco, CA
(Airfare Denver to San Francisco at $350;
5 nights at $250 per night;
5 days per diem at $76 per day;
ground transportation at $100).

Facilities and Administration (F&A) Costs
-----------------------------------------

Facilities and Administration (F&A) costs are charged according
to the University's federally negotiated rate agreement.
The F&A cost rate for on-campus research is 53 percent
of Modified Total Direct Cost (MTDC),
predetermined for the period 7/1/14--6/30/15,
53.5 percent of MTDC,
predetermined for the period 7/1/15--6/30/16;
54 percent MTDC,
predetermined for the period 7/1/16--6/30/18;
provisional thereafter per HHS agreement dated 07/27/2017.

Inflation
---------

The University of Colorado's current budget planning parameters
include an annual inflation factor of 3 percent
for salaries of investigators, post-doctoral researchers,
graduate research assistant, and hourly students.
Tuition is estimated to increase 3 percent per year,
fringe benefits are estimated to increase 4 percent per year,
and other direct costs such as travel,
are inflated at 2.3 percent per year.
Inflation of other direct costs is optional.
