# Facilities and Equipment #

## University of Colorado ##

A comprehensive Research 1 public university, CU Boulder campus has a long
(>50 year) tradition of interdisciplinary research and enjoys formal research
relationships with nearby national research laboratories including NIST, NOAA,
NCAR/UCAR, USGS, and NREL, as well as numerous industry partners.

## Computing

The CSDMS High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC) beach.colorado.edu is an
8 TFlops Altix XE 1300 SGI cluster (with a total of 704 cores) that consists
of:

- 64 Altix XE320 compute nodes (8 cores; 3 GHz Harpertown processors; 16 GB
  memory)
- 24 Altix XE320 high memory compute nodes (8 cores; 3 GHz Harpertown
  processors; 32 GB memory; 250 GB temporary storage)
- Altix XE250 login node (8 cores; 3 GHz Harpertown processors; 32 GB memory;
  2 TB storage)
- Altix XE250 NFS server (8 cores; 3 GHz Harpertown processors; 16 GB memory;
  250 GB temporary storage)

Computes nodes are connected with both and fully non-blocking quad-data rate
InfiniBand fabric (measured unidirectional bandwidth of 12 Gb/s; bidirectional
bandwidth of 21 Gb/s), as well as gigabit Ethernet.

All nodes are able to access 72 TB (40 TB usable) of RAID storage through NFS.

Beach provides GNU and Intel compilers, a suite of various MPI compilers
(mvapich, mpich, openmpi) that have been optimized for the cluster’s
configuration. Users are also provided with versions of Matlab, IDL, Python,
as well as visualization software.

The main power management is an APC UPS with 30 minutes of uptime at 50%
load. The Beach login node and storage are backed-up by a separate SGI
installed UPS system. Beach is supported by the CU ITS Managed Services
(UnixOps) under contract to CSDMS.

## Peripherals

B&W and Color LaserJet printers, Color Scanners, and a HP Design Jet 5000PS
60” plotter.

## ECI & CSDMS Security

Physical access is restricted out of formal hours, holidays and weekends.
The Facilities electronic locking system is managed by CU Access Services.
The user list is controlled and kept up-to-date.  The OS is RedHat Enterprise
with up-to-date patches. For remote login, clear-text protocols (i.e. FTP,
Telnet) are blocked; SSH connections apply. Login from peripheral PCs and Macs
is via SSH and requires username and password. The ECI benefits from
technical advices and alerts given across the campus network by the central
Colorado University ITS contractor. The ECI is within the CU domain protected
by a firewall. 

## Office space

*Office space*: INSTAAR has access to several conference rooms (that can hold
20 to 60 people). Office space for Postdoctoral position and graduate student
are provided by INSTAAR. Typically, a Postdoctoral fellow could share his
office with one other researcher. Graduate students are typically sharing
offices with 1or 2 other students.
