# Statement of Work – University of Colorado Sub-Award

## Food-Energy-Water Systems in Mountainous Coastal Watersheds: Examining historical trajectories and the influence of human decisions

### PI: Eric W. H. Hutton, Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado

Dr. Hutton is an investigator on the proposed grant to the National Science
Foundation, Climate Change in a Coupled Geomorphic-Economic Coastal System.
NSF requires that funding for collaborating institutions be executed through
a sub award under the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems program.

The University of Colorado will participate in the model development and
coupling aspects of the proposed project.

Over the course of the 4-year project PI Eric Hutton will supervise the
coding work required to allow two (or more) models to dynamically exchange
information during their runs, functioning essentially as a single coupled
model. Tasks will include:

- Work with model developers to ensure their models conform to the CSDMS
  standards and protocols that allow them to be incorporated into the CSDMS
  model-coupling framework (standards described here:
  http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/BMI_Description).
- Ensure model compatibility through data exchange items.
- Individual models wrapped as components within the CSDMS modeling framework.
- Components and couplings are available through the CSDMS Component Modeling
  Tool.
- Organization of model source code within open source repositories (source
  code will be housed on GitHub).

### Milestones in the project

*Year 1*: Attend kick-off meeting.  
*Year 2*: Coupled simulations of the geomorphic models. Simulations will be
able to be run within the CSDMS modeling framework.  
*Year 3*: Preliminary agent-based economic models will be wrapped with a
Basic Modeling Interface to couple with geomorphic models. Source code for
the economic models will be publicly available on GitHub (or similar).  
*Year 4*: Final coupling simulations of the geomorphic and agent-based
economic models.
