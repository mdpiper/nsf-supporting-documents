Budget Justification
====================

Software Engineer
-----------------

Requirements include experience with system software and surface dynamic
modeling (delta and near-shore processes, in particular), model coupling,
abilities in high level (e.g. IDL, Matlab) and operational level (e.g. C,
C++, Fortran, Python) languages, grid and mesh generation, and numerical
methods (e.g. Eulerian, Lagrangian, implicit/explicit solvers, finite
difference, and finite element methods).

Eric Hutton is the Senior Software Engineer on the NSF-funded CSDMS
(Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System) project. He has proven
experience in multi-language codes, sediment transport and geophysical model
development, and model coupling. Duties will include overseeing and
coordinating the model development necessary to componentize the identified
models so that they conform to the CSDMS model-coupling protocols.
(2 months/y in years 2, 3, and 4)

Travel
------

One trip to Seattle per year to attend an annual team meeting.

Accounting Technician and System Administration
-----------------------------------------------

Partial salary is requested for technical assistance to support the executing,
administration and accounting of Center activities. INSTAAR is a unique unit
of the University of Colorado.  It is solely dedicated to research and
completely separated, though complimentary, to the traditional academic
departments.  INSTAAR is an interdisciplinary Earth and Environmental Systems
Institute, and houses large and complex research programs.  Each individual
investigator has access to a depth and broad range of scientific expertise
that complements his/her research. The system Administrator is responsible for
the IT needs of the project.

Indirect Costs
--------------

Indirect costs are charged according to our federally negotiated rate
agreement. The indirect cost rate for on-campus research is 53.5% of Modified
Total Direct Cost (MTDC), predetermined for the period 7/1/2015-6/30/2016;
54% MTDC, predetermined for the period 7/1/2016-6/30/2018; provisional
thereafter per HHS agreement dated 7/20/2015.

*Communication, Duplication & Postage*: includes such items as toll calls,
postage, fax charges, telephone lines, and photocopies that specifically
support this project. The University of Colorado maintains telecommunication
services that include the capability of tracking expenses to specific projects.
INSTAAR maintains photocopy services that include capability of tracking
expenses to specific projects.  The project includes co-investigators in other
states, and will be working with scientists from around the world. Activities
will include surface mail, fax, teleconferencing, and duplication of shared
material.

Fringe Benefits
---------------

Fringe Benefits are calculated on requested salary per the University's
federally negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement, with the Department of
Health and Human Services (DHHS). Applicable rates are 30% for academic
faculty, 37.3% for research personnel, and 13.2% for graduate research
assistants.

Inflation
---------

The University of Colorado's current budget planning parameters include an
annual inflation factor of 3% for salaries for investigators, post-doctoral
researchers, graduate research assistants, and hourly students. Tuition is
estimated to increase 4% per year, fringe benefits are estimated to increase
3.5% per year, and all other direct costs are estimated to increase 2.5% per
year.
